              <p> h1 means heading 1 so it probably makes the font size since when i look at the website in the browser it is a large font on H1 then it gets smaller as it go down the numbers. The Doctype tag explains the code we are using and the head makes what ever you say appear first. I think that the H in the body means the font size because if i was to swap the order it possibly wouldn't change. The p means its going to be a paragraph and allopwws you to type multiple sentences at once or formats it as one making it like this.  </p>

        <p> HTML is important to me because without html the world would not be anle to function since we wouldn't have websites on the internet and games to play since you have to code things with html in games as well. when i first heard of html i thought it was a code since i was nine but not like this type of code i mean like a password. I began to learn more about what html actually was when my dad who is a programer for a company that makes and help devolope technology for public transportation when he started working from home and also when he tried to show me how to make my own website. Web design is important to me because i am able to make anything i want in a website and show it publicly on the internet for others to see. </p>
