        <p>
          When I grow up i want to become pilot preferably a bomber pilot becuase i won't be alone if i die and if they develop a new bomb i might be able  to test it or at least witness it in action or carry a team recodin it for science like they did with the first atomic bomb. ZI also fly the B-52 or the B-1 lancer. I also want too fly when i grow up and bombers are the closest to a commercial plane
        </p>
        <p> I am already doing private pilot classes and next year i am able to get my pilots license. So i can say i am already preparing i also can get a flight simulator for DCS configured to a bombeer or a fighter because i am slightly interested in those but they mean if you crash you are left alone. I also am in a program over the summer where i can learn how to actually fly.</p>
        <p> some colleges i can go to is vaughn college and also the USAFAC which is the US air force academy.  I also can go to Hampton university. I also am doing flight classes at vaughn college which are very boring i already know how the engine and fuel systems work as well as the basics for flying.</p>
