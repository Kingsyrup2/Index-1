    <p>the image above is my favicon creation i made it using binary code with 9 pixels since i found it easier than hexi decimals in the type of code i used i used only 1s and 0s because the 1s signify the added color and the 0s signafied black so if there were 1s in any section it would make the color combimnation and you have to pay attention to what you used more than this code. The favicon in black and white had no mixture to it because if you put a 0- it would be black and a 1 would be counted as a white you can put spaces and it won't effect the combination or order of the design.</p>
    <p> THere are two ways to make a favicon creation 1 using the hexidecimal system which i feel is a equivalent to guessing answers on a test and then there's binary code which is much easier  to work with because all you have to do is set the code of 1s and 0s properly and like i said in the last paragraph i prefer using it in the 9 pixel form since it's easy to work with and also easyier to use.</p>
