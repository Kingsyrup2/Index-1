        <h1>My first take on a resume</h1>

        <p>I am a sophmore at Thomas A. Edison Career and technical highschool.Since it's a CTE school that means it prepares you for work after school. Some people can get out of school and get a job in the career they were trained in. My CTE shop is web design this so far is the only thing i have made on my own.THis so far is what i know all i can do is out in images and also hyper link them.in web design we were tought that team work is important and we were told to build a paper tower as a team. This week we started actual coding with hyper links and stuff like that.I'm updating this as it goes along so there isn't much now. i figured out how to do color so now i can customize the webpages background but i'm not sure about pictures.I just want to say the websites bellow i didn't make myself. </p>
